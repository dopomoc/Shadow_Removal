# Shadow_Removal
Shadow removal benchmarking. Includes data set and online functionality to independently evaluate performance of shadow removal algorithms versus held-out ground truth.

See: http://cs.bath.ac.uk/~hg299/shadow_eval/eval.php

Han Gong - while completing his PhD with me at Bath - also published several papers in the area of shadow removal.
Even better - he put most of his code online1
